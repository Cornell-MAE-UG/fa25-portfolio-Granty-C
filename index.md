## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi, my name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an engineering student at Cornell University passionate about embedded systems, microfluidics, and mechatronics.  

I enjoy designing custom hardware and control systems that bridge electronics, software, and mechanics. My experience ranges from building multi-channel microfluidic pumps with closed-loop PID control, to restoring and modernizing high-performance marine engines with custom ECUs, to developing autonomous navigation robots.  

I thrive at the intersection of hands-on design and applied research, having contributed to biotech projects (flow-electroporation, Faradaic efficiency tracking, bubble mitigation) that have led to a manuscript submission, patent application, and NIH SBIR funding.
